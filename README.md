# 🧠 Multi-Agent Research Assistant and a simple MCP based calculator(A2A + MCP)

These project combines **Python-A2A** (a simple, production-ready implementation of Google's A2A protocol) with **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** to build a modular, reliable multi-agent research assistant.

## ✅ Why This Matters

🤝 With a 2-tier architecture (A2A + MCP), we get:

- Reduced integration work with easy component replacement  
- Clear error boundaries  
- Extensible and reusable architecture  

## 🛠 Highlights

- Sequential multi-agent workflow  
- Stateless, standardized communication  
- Modular, interoperable, and production-ready design
